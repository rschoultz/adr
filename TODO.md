# To do

[ ] Date format configurable. US format may not be wanted, but on the other hand, RFC-3339 is not beautiful either. This was maybe to go overboard.

[ ] Generate contents. `adr generate toc`


# Done

[X] Better date format,  yyyy-mm-dd

[X] Use EDITOR/VISUAL

[X] Per project configuration and templates

[X] Clean up the directory/path mangling.
