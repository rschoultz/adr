# To do

[ ] Better date format,  yyyy-mm-dd

[ ] Date format configurable. US format may not be wanted, but on the other hand, RFC-3339 is not beautiful either. This was maybe to go overboard.

[ ] Generate contents. `adr generate toc`

[ ] Clean up the directory/path mangling.

# Done

[X] ~~Use EDITOR/VISUAL~~

[X] ~~Per project configuration and templates~~
